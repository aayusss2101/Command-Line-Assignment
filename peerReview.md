###Mohan Gundluri

<br/>

**Question 1**

- He has used the date function with different formatting to get date and time
- He has used the whoami command to get the current user, alternatively he could have used the environment variable USER to do so.
- He has used the environment variable HOME to get the home directory.
- He has used the pwd command to get the current working directory, alternatively he could have used the environment variable PWD to do so.
<br/>
**Question 2**
- He has taken the input from the command line in the form of an array.
- He is checking the length of the array to decide if input is given or not.
- He has used a while loop to loop over all the inputs.
- He has used an inner while loop to find the table.
<br/>
**Question 3**
- He has taken input from the user by using the read command.
- He is not checking if input is provided or not.
- He has created a function named is_prime to check if the number is prime or not.
- He has first checked if the number is less than 2, and printed the message that its not a prime.
- He has then used the bc command to find the square root of the number.
- He has then used a for loop to find the proper factors of the number.
- If any factor is found, he is printing the message and returning from the function
- If the loop is completed, he is printing the message that the number is prime.
<br/>
**Question 4**
- He has used mkdir command to create directory.
- He has used touch command to create file.
- He has used the >> operator to add Table.sh file content.
- He has used the >> operator to append with the message.
- He has used ls operator with -lah options to show Desktop directory contents.
- He has used absolute path everywhere, sometimes utilising the ~ expansion.
<br/>
**Question 5**
- He has used two approaches.
- He has used the sort command with option -r to sort in descending order, piped with head command with option -1 to find the maximum number.
- He has used the sort command, piped with head command with option -1 to find the minimum number.
- In another approach, he has used a loop to traverse the array and used if statements to find maximum and minimum number.
